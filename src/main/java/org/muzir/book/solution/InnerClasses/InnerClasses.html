	<p>It appears that inner classes are just a name hiding and code
		organization scheme, which is helpful. Another feature of inner
		classes when you create an inner class, an object of that inner class
		has a link to the enclosing object that made it, and so it can access
		the members of that enclosing object without any special
		qualifications. In addition, inner classes has the access rights all
		the members of the outer classes.</p>

	<p>Inner class has automatic access to the members of the enclosing
		class. HOW? Inner classes secretly captures a reference for creating
		it. Then, when you refer to a member of the enclosing class, that
		reference is used to select member.</p>
