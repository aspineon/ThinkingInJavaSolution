	<p>It appears that inner classes are just a name hiding and code
		organization scheme, which is helpful. Another feature of inner
		classes when you create an inner class, an object of that inner class
		has a link to the enclosing object that made it, and so it can access
		the members of that enclosing object without any special
		qualifications. In addition, inner classes has the access rights all
		the members of the outer classes.</p>
	<p class="page">349</p>
	<p>Inner class has automatic access to the members of the enclosing
		class. HOW? Inner classes secretly captures a reference for creating
		it. Then, when you refer to a member of the enclosing class, that
		reference is used to select member.</p>
	<p class="page">353</p>
	<p>Non inner classes can't be private or protected. They just can
		be public or package access level.</p>
	<p class="page">361</p>
	<p>Anonymous inner classes are somewhat limited compared to regular
		inheritance, because they can either extend a class or implement an
		interface, but not both. And if you do implement an interface, you can
		only implement one</p>
	<p class="page">364</p>
	<p>If you don't need a connection between inner and outer class you
		can define nested classes which mean static inner classes. Inner
		classes holds the reference of the outer classes. But nested classes
		don't have this outer class reference.</p>
	<p class="page">381</p>
	<p>With the help of inner classes, we can simulate multiple
		inheritance.Because we can create different implementation for
		interfaces, abstract classes also use outer class too. So like extends
		both outer classes and abstract classes.</p>
	<p class="page">387</p>
	<p>If you need a named constructor or if you need a more than one
		object of that class, you can prefer local inner class instead of
		anonymous class.Otherwise they are same.</p>
