	<p>In abstract class methods don't have to be abstract. If it is
		abstract, derived class must implement it just like interfaces.
		Abstractness is a mixed form of inheritance and interfaces.</p>
	<p class="page">316</p>
	<p>Interfaces only has declarations but abstract classes can have
		fields,declarations and methods with implementation. So interfaces and
		abstract classes differentiate with this feature.</p>
	<p class="page">316</p>
	<p>Interfaces are like "protocols" between classes.Some object
		oriented languages have this keyword just do the same thing with
		interfaces.</p>
	<p class="page">316</p>
	<p>An interface can also contain fields,but these fields are
		implicitly static and final.Interfaces methods are public by default.</p>
	<p class="page">328</p>
	<p>If it is possible to create base class without method definition
		and initial variables, it is better to create them as an interface.</p>
	<p class="page">328</p>
	<p>Ant abstraction should be motivated by real need. Interfaces
		should be something you refactor to when necessary</p>
