	<p>Creating unique package name; the first part of the package name
		is the reversed internet domain name of the creator of the class.

	<p>CLASSPATH contains one or more directories that are used as
		roots in a search for .class files. Starting at that root, the
		interpreter will take the package name and replace each dot with a
		slash to generate a path name of the CLASSPATH package foo.bar.baz
		become foo/bar/baz or foo\bar\baz or something else depending on the
		operating system</p>

	<p>main class not found exception is always about this package
		structure issues. Package name should be implement in a directory
		structure.</p>
	<p>javac Simple.java is not a problem to find but if Simple.java
		contains a package name like foo and you create .class file a
		different structure than foo folder so it is not found by JVM when
		type java Simple</p>
