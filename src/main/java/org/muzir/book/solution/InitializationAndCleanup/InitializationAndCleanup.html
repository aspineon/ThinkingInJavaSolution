	<p>Atomicity of allocation and initialization: "new" operator
		allocates memory for new object, if allocation successful then
		constructor call for initialization</p>
	<p class="page">Page 172</p>
	<p>Some people argue that static methods are not object-oriented,
		since they do have the semantics of a global method; with a static
		method, you don't send a message to an object, since there is no this.</p>
	<p>This is probably a fair argument, and if you find yourself using
		a lot of static methods, you should probably rethink your
		strategy.However, statics are pragmatic, and there are times when
		actually need them.</p>
	<p class="page">Page 172</p>
	<p>There is no "this" for inside static context. You can not call
		non-static methods inside static methods.</p>
	<p class="page">Page 174</p>
	<p>finalize()method is necessary for C like allocation like Native
		method call from Java. because this kind of call create object with
		alloc(or malloc) and Java GC don't realize these objects so finalize
		usage can be suitable for this case</p>
	<p class="page">Page 175</p>
	<p>Joshua Block mention in Effective Java avoid finalizers.
		Finalizers are unprediactable, often dangerous and generally
		unnecesary.</p>
	<p class="page">Page 178</p>
	<p>Reference counting is a simple and slow approach, each object
		has a reference counter when a reference point object its increase the
		count, if reference is out of scope or set null decrease the
		counter.JVM collect object's which reference count is 0. But it
		doesn't seem to be used in any JVM implementation.</p>

		C++ heap as a yard where each object stakes out its own piece of turf.
		In some JVMs, the Java Heap is quite different; it is more like <a
			href="https://d2t1xqejof9utc.cloudfront.net/screenshots/pics/f2666f37283ef30d8ca46f9c46267430/medium.gif">a
			conveyor belt</a> that moves forward into virgin territory, so it's
		effectively the same as C++'s stack allocation.
	</p>
	<p class="page">Page 178</p>
	<p>You might observe that heap isn't in fact a conveyor belt, and
		if you treat in that way, you'll start paging memory-moving it on and
		off disk, so that you can appear to have more memory than you actually
		do. Paging significantly impacts performance. Eventually, after you
		create enough objects, you'll run out of memory. The tricks is that
		the garbage collector steps in, and while it collects the garbage it
		compacts all the objects in the heap so that you have effectively
		moved the "heap pointer" closer to the beginning of the conveyor belt
		and farther away from a page fault. The garbage collector rearranges
		things and make it possible for the high speed, infinite-free-heap
		model to be used while allocating storage."</p>
	<p class="page">Page 179</p>
	<p>In faster schemes, garbage collection is not based on reference
		counting. Instead, it is based on the idea that any non-dead object
		must ultimately be traceable back to reference that lives either on
		the stack or in the static storage. The chain might go through several
		layers of objects. Thus, if you start in the stack and in the static
		storage area and walk through all the references, you will find all
		the live objects. For each reference that you find, you must trace
		into the objects they point to, etc., until you've moved through the
		entire Web that originated with the references on the stack or in the
		static storage. Each object that you move through must still be alive.
		Note that there is no problem with detached self-referential
		groups(like new Person() not have references(handler))these are simply
		not found, and are therefore automatically garbage.</p>
	<p class="page">Page 179</p>
	<p>
		In the approach described here, the JVM uses an <i>adaptive</i>
		garbage-collection scheme, and what it does with the live objects that
		it locates depends on the variant currently being used. One of these
		variants is <i>stop-and-copy.</i>This means that-for reasons that will
		become apparent-the program is first stopped. Then, each live objects
		is copied from one heap to another, leaving behind all the garbage. In
		addition, as the objects are copied into the new heap, they are packed
		end-to-end, thus compacting the new heap.
	</p>
	<p class="page">Page 179-180</p>
	<p>There are two issues that make these so-called "copy collectors"
		inefficient. The first is the idea that you have two heaps and you
		slosh all the memory back and forth between these two separate heaps,
		maintaining twice as much memory as you actually need.Some JVMs deal
		with this by allocating the heap in chunks as needed and simply
		copying from one chunk to another.</p>
	<p class="page">Page 180</p>
	<p>
		The second issue is the copying process itself. Once your program
		becaomes stable, it might be generating little or no garbage.Despite
		that, a copy collector will still copy all the memory from one place
		to another, which is wasteful. To prevent this, some JVMs detect that
		no new garbage is being generated and switch to different scheme(this
		is "adaptive" part).This other scheme is called <i>mark-and-sweep</i>,
		and it's what earlier versions of Sun's JVM used all the time. For
		general use, mark-and-sweep is fairly slow, but when you know you're
		generating little or no garbage, it's fast.
	</p>
	<p class="page">Page 181</p>
	<p>The JVM monitors the efficiency of garbage collection and if it
		becomes a waste of time because all objects are long-lived, the it
		switched to mark-and-sweep. Similarly, the JVM keeps track of how
		sucessful mark-and-sweep is, and if the heap starts to become
		fragmented, it switches back to stop-and-copy. This is where the
		"adaptive" part comes in, so you end up with a mouthful:"Adaptive
		generational stop-and-copy mark-and-sweep."</p>
	<p class="page">Page 181</p>
	<p>
		There are a number of additional speedups possible in JVM. An
		especially important one involves the operation of the loader and what
		is called a <i>just-in-time(JIT)</i> compiler. A JIT compiler
		partially or fully converts a program into native machine code so that
		it doesn't need to be loaded(typically, the first time you want to
		create an object of that class), the .class file is located, and the
		bytecodes for that class are brought into memory. At this point, one
		approach is to simply JIT compile all the code, but this has two
		drawbacks: It takes a little more time, which, compounded throughout
		the life of the program, can add up; and it increases the size of the
		executable (bytecodes are significantly more compact than expanded JIT
		code), and this might cause paging, which definitely slows down a
		program. An alternative approach is lazy evaluation, which means that
		the code is not JIT compiled until necessary. Thus Java HotSpot
		technologies in recent JDKs take a similar approach by increasingly
		optimizing a piece of code each time it is executed, so the more the
		code is executed, faster it gets.

	<p>You can not apply the static keyword to local variables, so it
		only applies to class fields. If a field is a static primitive type
		and you don't initialize it, it gets the standard initial value for
		its type.</p>
	<p class="page">Page 188</p>
	<p>Static objects are created once, They are initialized only when
		the first Table object is created(or the first static access occurs)
		After that the static access are not reinitialized.</p>
	<p class="page">Page 189</p>
	<p>The order of initialization is statics first if they haven't
		already been initialized by a previous object creation and then the
		non-static objects.</p>

	<p>The static initializers for Cups run when either the access of
		the static object cup1 occurs like:</p>
	Cups.cup1.f(99);
	<p>
	<p>class Cups{</p>
	<p>static Cup cup1;</p>
	<p>static Cup cup2;</p>
	<p>static{</p>
	<p>cup1=new Cup(1);</p>
	<p>cup2=new Cup(2);</p>
	<p>}</p>
	<p>Cups{</p>
	<p>print("Cups()")</p>
	<p>}Output</p>
	<p>Cups(1)</p>
	<p>Cup(2)</p>
	<p>f(99)</p>
