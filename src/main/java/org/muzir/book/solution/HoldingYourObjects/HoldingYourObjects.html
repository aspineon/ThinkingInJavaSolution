	<p>The name of the add() method suggests that it puts a new element
		in the Collection. Hovewer, the documentation carefully states that
		add() "ensures that this Collection contains the specified element."
		This is to allow for meaning of Set, which adds the element only if it
		isn't already there. With an ArrayList, or any sort of List, add()
		always means "put it in," because Lists don't care if there are
		duplicates.</p>

		Check AslistInference.java which show a new implementation whcih
