	<p>Polymorphismis the third essential feature of object oriented
		programming, others are data abstraction and inheritance.</p>
	<p class="page">Page 277</p>
	<p>Polymorphism also called dynamic binding or late binding or
		runtime binding</p>
	<p class="page">Page 281</p>
	<p>When binding is performed before the program is run(by the
		compiler and linker just like C), it is called early binding.</p>
	<p class="page">Page 282</p>
	<p>All method binding in Java uses late binding except static or
		final methods(private methods are implicitly final)</p>
	<p class="page">Page 282</p>
	<p>If a language support late binding, this means class which get
		the message determined at runtime with the help of method call.</p>
	<p class="page">Page 282</p>
	<p>If you declare a method final, it means it can not overrided so
		it can not use late binding.</p>

		Polymorphism is an important technique for the programmer to "seperate
		the things that change from the things that stay the same". this
		provide <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle">OPEN-CLOSED
			principle</a> Open the extention closed to modification

	<p class="page">Page 291</p>
	<p>The list of messages receivable by an object depends on the type
		of its handle, while the method that gets called depends on its type.</p>
	<p class="page">Page 291</p>
	<p>Direct filed access is determined at compile time Please check
		org.muzir.book.solution.Polymorphism.FieldAccess class.</p>
	<p class="page">Page 303</p>
	<p>Good guideline for constructors:Do as little as possible to the
		object into a good state, and if you can possibly avoid it, don't call
		any other methods in this class.</p>
