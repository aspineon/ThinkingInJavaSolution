	<p>Polymorphismis the third essential feature of object oriented
		programming, others are data abstraction and inheritance.</p>
	<p class="page">Page 277</p>
	<p>Polymorphism also called dynamic binding or late binding or
		runtime binding</p>
	<p class="page">Page 281</p>
	<p>When binding is performed before the program is run(by the
		compiler and linker just like C), it is called early binding.</p>
	<p class="page">Page 282</p>
	<p>All method binding in Java uses late binding except static or
		final methods(private methods are implicitly final)</p>
	<p class="page">Page 282</p>
	<p>If a language support late binding, this means class which get
		the message determined at runtime with the help of method call.</p>
	<p class="page">Page 282</p>
	<p>If you declare a method final, it means it can not overrided so
		it can not use late binding.</p>
