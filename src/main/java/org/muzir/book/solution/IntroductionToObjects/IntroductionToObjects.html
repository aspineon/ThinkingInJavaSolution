	<p>Late Binding: Compiler do not know exact code at compile time.
		OOP can not determine the address of the code until runtime.</p>
	<p>C++ uses virtual keyword for late bindings.</p>
	<p class="page">Page 42</p>
	<p>In a is-a relation: "Circle is a shape"
		Circle---->Shape(Upcasting) Shape---->Circle(Downcasting)</p>
	<p class="page">Page 44</p>
	<p>ArrayList and LinkedList both implements List interface but
		these two are differentiate at operations performans such as random
		access takes constant time at ArrayList or insert an element to middle
		of list LinkedList has better performance.</p>
	<p class="page">Page 45</p>
	<p>(NON Generic Containers) When add a specific object to a list,
		Java upcasting the specific object to Object class and when get it you
		just get an Object. You should exactly know object type which is
		before put the containers and downcast it to its type.</p>
	<p class="page">Page 48</p>
	<p>Languages that allow objects to be created on the stack, the
		compiler determines how long the object lasts and automatically
		destroy it. If you create the object at heap compiler don't know its
		lifetime.</p>
	<p class="page">Page 49</p>
	<p>Exception handling is must in Java, because compiler give errors
		if you don't declare or catch the exception.Exception handling existed
		before object-oriented languages.(Like in C)</p>

	<p>Server side programming has been performed using Perl,
		Phyton,C++ or some other languages to create CGI(Common Gateway
		Interface) programs.Java create Java Web Servlets and servlet
		programming alternative for CGI programs.</p>
